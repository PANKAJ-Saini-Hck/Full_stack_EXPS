**Experiment Title:**  
Implementation of Student Sign-Up Form using HTML and CSS  
(Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS)


## 3. Approach

The aim of this experiment was to create a Student Sign-Up Form and understand different ways of applying CSS in HTML.

The same form was designed using three CSS methods:
### 1. Inline CSS
- CSS was applied directly inside HTML tags.
- This method is simple but not suitable for large projects.
- Used only for basic understanding.

### 2. Internal CSS
- CSS was written inside the `<style>` tag in the HTML file.
- This keeps design and content in one file.
- Suitable for small or single-page projects.

### 3. External CSS
- CSS was written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML file.
- This method keeps code clean and easy to manage.
- It is the best approach for real-world applications.

### Conclusion
This experiment helped in understanding the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS.  
Among all three, external CSS is the most efficient and professional method.
